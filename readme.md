## Objectives
A very simple implementation of the Monopoly game.

## Things to consider
- This does not implement all the rules (no mortages, rent prices are not correct, the "hotel" is just another house, not every property has actions, no change and chest, the list has no end)
- There are **A LOT** of bugs.
- Since the task was to be done in 1/2 hour, I guess tests were out of the question.
- This is not a finished product, please open it on a browser greater than 1024px wide.

## Demo
Visit the demo page http://samura.github.io/monopoly/

## Requirements
- npm

## Installation
This show be enough to get everything installed and server running.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samura/monopoly
cd monopoly
npm start
``` 
Now you just have to visit http://localhost:8000
